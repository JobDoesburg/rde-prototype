\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Stephen Kellaway\footnote{\url{https://github.com/playtime222}} in particular, who has been working on a similar project for the Dutch RDW\footnote{\url{https://www.rdw.nl}} and who helped me a lot during the early stages of my project, getting the first version of my Kotlin library to work.

Apart from that, I would like to thank my supervisors at SURF, William van Santen and Nils Vogels, for being great conversation partners to discuss this project with.
